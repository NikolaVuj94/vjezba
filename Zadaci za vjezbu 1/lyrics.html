    <p>On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair
        Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air
        Up ahead in the distance, I saw a shimmering light
        My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim
        I had to stop for the night
        There she stood in the doorway;
        I heard the mission bell
        And I was thinking to myself,
        "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"
        Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way
        There were voices down the corridor,
        I thought I heard them say... <br><br>
        Welcome to the Hotel California
        Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
        Such a lovely face
        Plenty of room at the Hotel California
        Any time of year (Any time of year)
        You can find it here<br><br>
        Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes bends
        She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends
        How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat.
        Some dance to remember, some dance to forget <br><br>
        So I called up the Captain,
        "Please bring me my wine"
        He said, "We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"
        And still those voices are calling from far away,
        Wake you up in the middle of the night
        Just to hear them say...<br><br>
        Welcome to the Hotel California
        Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place)
        Such a lovely face
        They livin' it up at the Hotel California
        What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)
        Bring your alibis <br><br>
        Mirrors on the ceiling,
        The pink champagne on ice
        And she said "We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"
        And in the master's chambers,
        They gathered for the feast
        They stab it with their steely knives,
        But they just can't kill the beast <br><br>
        Last thing I remember, I was
        Running for the door
        I had to find the passage back
        To the place I was before
        "Relax, " said the night man,
        "We are programmed to receive.
        You can check-out any time you like,
        But you can never leave! "</p>

        <h1 id="stairway">Stairway to Heaven</h1>
        <p>There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
            And she's buying a stairway to heaven
            When she gets there she knows, if the stores are all closed
            With a word she can get what she came for
            Ooh, ooh, and she's buying a stairway to heaven
            There's a sign on the wall, but she wants to be sure
            'Cause you know sometimes words have two meanings
            In a tree by the brook, there's a songbird who sings
            Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven <br><br>
            You know
            There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
            And my spirit is crying for leaving
            In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
            And the voices of those who stand looking
            That's you
            And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
            Then the piper will lead us to reason
            And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
            And the forests will echo with laughter
            Remember laughter?<br><br>
            Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
            And it makes me wonder
            If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now
            It's just a spring clean for the May queen
            Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run
            There's still time to change the road you're on
            Your head is humming and it won't go, in case you don't know
            The piper's calling you to join him<br>
            Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow, and did you know
            Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
            And as we wind on down the road
            Our shadows taller than our soul
            There walks a lady we all know
            Who shines white light and wants to show
            How everything still turns to gold
            And if you listen very hard
            The tune will come to you at last
            When all is one and one is all, that's what it is
            To be a rock and not to roll, oh yeah
            And she's buying a stairway to heaven</p>

            <h1 id="bohemian">Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
            <p>Is this the real life?
                Is this just fantasy?
                Caught in a landside,
                No escape from reality
                Open your eyes,
                Look up to the skies and see,
                I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
                Because I'm easy come, easy go,
                Little high, little low,
                Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to
                Me, to me <br><br>
                Mamaaa,
                Just killed a man,
                Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger,
                Now he's dead
                Mamaaa, life had just begun,
                But now I've gone and thrown it all away
                Mama, oooh,
                Didn't mean to make you cry,
                If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
                Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters<br><br>
                Too late, my time has come,
                Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all
                The time
                Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go,
                Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
                Mama, oooh
                I don't want to die,
                I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.
                I see a little silhouetto of a man,<br><br>
                Scaramouch, Scaramouch, will you do the Fandango!
                Thunderbolts and lightning, very, very frightening me
                Galileo, Galileo
                Galileo, Galileo
                Galileo, Figaro - magnificoo
                I'm just a poor boy nobody loves me
                He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
                Spare him his life from this monstrosity
                Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
                Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
                (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
                (Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
                (Let me go) Will not let you go
                (Let me go)(Never) Never let you go
                (Let me go) (Never) let you go (Let me go) Ah
                No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br><br>
                Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia, let me go
                Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me,
                For meee
                So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
                So you think you can love me and leave me to die
                Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
                Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
                Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
                Nothing really matters,
                Nothing really matters to me
                Any way the wind blows...</p>
